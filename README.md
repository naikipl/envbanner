# EnvBanner

This is a chrome extension that places banners on webpages for different environments

The current implementation of EnvBanner is targeted at NZPost API pages, localhost:3000 and *.dev

## To Do
- Allow the user to set which urls are used to inject the banner
- Allow the user to set the text on banners
- Instead of using .png banners, implement some fancy CSS


### HAPPY BANNER-ING!
